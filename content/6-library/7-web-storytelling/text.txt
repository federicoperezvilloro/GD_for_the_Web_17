Much ink has been spilt lately bemoaning the lack of quality content on the web.  “Sure the site flashes and whizzes and startles, but what does it have to say?”  This type of complaint assumes an incomplete, overly stark dichotomy: namely that sites are made up of “style” and “content.” The underlying purpose of style sheets and their widespread use has unintentionally fostered this false and overly simplistic dichotomy. You’ve got your style, you’ve got your content, and rarely the twain shall meet.
